Welcome to Jumper, the new kind of speedrun parkour game!

in this game, speed is'nt the only thing that matters: control is the key.

To win this game, you'll have to get right amount of speed: not enough speed and your character wont make it far. Too much speed and you'll go flying without being able to control anything.

One of the key mechanics of this game is wall climbing, that will speed up your character at insane speeds! the only advice i can give you is...

                                KEEP CONTROL
